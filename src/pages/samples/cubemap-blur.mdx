# Cubemap Blur

<SupportCheck ModelModule={ModelModule} />

Computes an approximate, perceptually-even Gaussian pyramid of a cubemap 
texture. Given an image and a desired maximum distance in pixels, for each
blurred mip level the process:

- Calculates the minimum angular distance between any pixel and a perimeter of 
    the given pixel distance
- Uses that minimum angle over 3 as the Guassian sigma for blurring
- For each pixel, samples all pixels of the previous mip within the given pixel distance
    and weights their contributions by the Guassian of their angular distances from the origin pixel
- Normalizes the result with the sum of the weights

For heavy loads that could impair smooth rendering or interactivity—such
as large images, high filter distances, or both at once—
[`requestAnimationFrame`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame)
is used to break up work over multiple frames.

This demo accepts .hdr cubemap textures to be uploaded and 
processed. Results are exported as an rgba32 .ktx2 file, including blurred mip levels.
*NOTE:* exported .ktx2 files are currently malformed and unreadable to some 
programs. This is likely due to a bug in the exporting library. Opening them with
[NVIDIA Texture Tools Exporter]('https://developer.nvidia.com/texture-tools-exporter') and
re-exporting fixes these issues.
