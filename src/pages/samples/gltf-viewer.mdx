[glTF Sample Assets](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Assets)
and environment maps are from 
[glTF Sample Environments](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Environments).

Unsupported features:

- Skinned Meshes
- Animations
- Cameras

Supported extensions:

- [KHR_materials_emissive_strength](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/main/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_materials_emissive_strength/README.md)
